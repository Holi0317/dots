# LunarVim configuration

[LunarVim] is a configuration layer (aka premake config which I don't want to spend another 1000 hours to work on)
for [neovim] >= 0.5.0.

[lunarvim]: https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim
[neovim]: https://neovim.io/

## Installation

Follow LunarVim installation process. Then link the configuration directory.

Note that in `zshrc`, we have aliased `vi`, `vim`, `nvim` to `lvim`.
